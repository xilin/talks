                        2. Question: Has anyone programmed on bluetooth before?
                        3. This is more like a college assignment report recording my research of BLE and ANCS. Please correct me if I make mistakes.

                            marketed as "Bluetooth Smart"
                            Bluetooth low energy (Bluetooth LE, BLE, marketed as Bluetooth Smart[1]) is a wireless personal area network technology designed and marketed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group aimed at novel applications in the healthcare, fitness, beacons,[2] security, and home entertainment industries.[3] Compared to Classic Bluetooth, Bluetooth Smart is intended to provide considerably reduced power consumption and cost while maintaining a similar communication range.

                            - The ATT is a wire application protocol for the [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) specification. It is closely related to Generic Attribute Profile (GATT).
                            - Provides the basis for all other profiles. GAP defines how two Bluetooth units discover and establish a connection with each other.
                            - Provides profile discovery and description services for [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) protocol. It defines how ATT attributes are grouped together into sets to form services.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bluetooth_profiles#cite_note-6)

                            * ATT: enables a device to reveal certain of its attributes to another device. The ATT block sets up peer-to-peer communication between an attribute server and a client to be able to exchange this information over a dedicated L2CAP channel

                            * Security Manager(SM): Security, Pairing

                            * GATT: defines the sub-procedures for using ATT and specifies the structure of Bluetooth profiles. All communications between Bluetooth devices are handled through GATT sub-procedures.

                            * GAP: provides the interface between the application and Bluetooth profiles and handles device discovery, connection, and services, including security procedures.

    - This descriptor, whose UUID is 0x2902, has a read/write 16-bit value, which is meant to be a bitmap.

A GATT notification delivered through the Notification Source characteristic contains the following information:

EventID: This field informs the accessory whether the given iOS notification was added, modified, or removed. The enumerated values for this field are defined in EventID Values.
EventFlags: A bitmask whose set bits inform an NC of specificities with the iOS notification. For example, if an iOS notification is considered “important”, the NC may want to display a more aggressive user interface (UI) to make sure the user is properly alerted. The enumerated bits for this field are defined in EventFlags.
CategoryID: A numerical value providing a category in which the iOS notification can be classified. The NP will make a best effort to provide an accurate category for each iOS notification. The enumerated values for this field are defined in CategoryID Values.
CategoryCount: The current number of active iOS notifications in the given category. For example, if two unread emails are sitting in a user’s email inbox, and a new email is pushed to the user’s iOS device, the value of CategoryCount is 3.
NotificationUID: A 32-bit numerical value that is the unique identifier (UID) for the iOS notification. This value can be used as a handle in commands sent to the Control Point characteristic to interact with the iOS notification.

                        Notification Actions

Starting with iOS 8.0, the NP can inform the NC of potential actions that are associated with iOS notifications. On the user’s behalf, the NC can then request the NP to perform an action associated with a specific iOS notification.

The NC is informed of the existence of performable actions on an iOS notification by detecting the presence of set flags in the EventFlags field of the GATT notifications generated by the Notification Source characteristic:

EventFlagPositiveAction: A positive action exists and is associated with this iOS notification.
EventFlagNegativeAction: A negative action exists and is associated with this iOS notification.
The actual actions performed by the NP on behalf of the NC are determined by the NP and vary depending on the iOS notification they are performed on. For example, performing a positive action on an Incoming Call notification may answer it, while performing a negative action may decline it.

The NC must neither assume nor try to guess in advance the exact action performed on an iOS Notification, because these actions are based upon information unavailable to it, as well as other factors such as the ANCS version implemented by the NP. The NP guarantees that positive and negative actions are associated with results that do not surprise the user.

If present for an iOS notification, positive and negative actions may be represented to the user as check marks, X marks, or colors commonly associated with acknowledgment and dismissal (such as green and red).

The NC can retrieve labels that succinctly describe the actual actions associated with an iOS notification by retrieving new notification attributes introduced in iOS 8.0:

NotificationAttributeIDPositiveActionLabel: The label used to describe the positive action that can be performed on the iOS notification.
NotificationAttributeIDNegativeActionLabel: The label used to describe the negative action that can be performed on the iOS notification.
